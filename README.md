## Introduction:

The 2018-19 Premier League season was undoubtedly one of the most exciting and interesting seasons in the recent history of the Premier League, with some of the most technical and competitive sides, including Jurgen Klopp's marvelous Liverpool, Mastermind Pep Guardiola’s powerful Manchester City, Maurizio Sarri’s revolutionary Chelsea, and Mauricio Pochettino’s miraculous Tottenham Hotspurs side. The race to the premier league championship was tense as two of the most powerful sides still had the chance to challenge the title until the last game day. These two sides were none other than the current title holders from the previous season, Manchester City and the glamorous Liverpool. Although the race between the two teams ended with Manchester City’s Glory, the Liverpool side of that year has not been backlashed for their hard work. 

This season wasn’t only significant in terms of football; it was also one of the most magnificent displays of premier league statistics and the main property that separates the Premier League from other European Leagues: the difference between each side in the premier league. The easiest way to infer this difference is by observing the financial statuses of different clubs and how these statuses have been reflected internally on the pitch. In basic terms, the teams with the highest transfer budgets also have better results on the scoreboard, except for a few exceptional teams with more internal impacts on-field results. When the end-of-season rankings are observed, the “high-table” (1-6) teams all have an average transfer budget above 100 million euros, while on the other hand, the “mid-table” (6 -14) teams had an average transfer budget slightly above 50 million euros signalling the impact of financial status on sportive success. The translation of lots of money inverted into quality football happens through better transfers, more scouting capacity and better facilities for the mental and physical status of the athletes. While league champion has the best facilities and scouting network in all of the league the relegated team Huddersfield had a more lacking system.

## Background Research:
The significance of transfer spending as a crucial determinant of team performance in the English Premier League (EPL). With the absence of a spending limit, clubs in the EPL have the freedom to allocate substantial transfer budgets, allowing them to acquire or retain players. The empirical analysis spanning multiple EPL seasons aims to uncover the intricate relationship between transfer spending and on-field success. Previous studies, such as Hall et al. (2002), have established a robust correlation between a club's payroll or transfer spending and its final standing in the league. This correlation suggests that the financial resources invested in transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a team's competitiveness and position in the league standings. The research also seeks to explore the speed at which increased transfer spending influences a club's performance, highlighting the dynamic nature of this relationship over time.
